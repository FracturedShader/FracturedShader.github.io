## My name is Robert Plante, and here you can find some of the things I have worked on.

### Learning is my passion with particular emphasis on real-time computer graphics and in pushing consumer hardware to do things I find fascinating.

#### My work attempts to leverage Data-Oriented Design techniques, multi-threading-based approaches, hardware vectorization, and letting the GPU do as much of the work as possible in order to push the limits of what can be simulated.
