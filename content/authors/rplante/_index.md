Learning is my greatest passion. Over the years I have honed my interests primarily to real time computer graphics as well as the topics that enable them. In addition to graphics APIs this includes the backing mathematical concepts for geometry and physics. Understanding CPUs, GPUs, their caches and vectorization options, as well as how they interact with memory in conjunction with their threading models has led to a different way of reasoning about the code I write. Finding the right architecture for a problem as well as leveraging data structures and algorithms to accelerate computation has allowed me to make some interesting projects. While these topics hold particular interest for me, I am always learning about exciting ideas in math, physics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other similar topics in my spare time.
